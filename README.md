# Shields-Up
  Shields Up is a massive plugin package that seeks to expand the universe of [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) through a number of different plugins, all with their own content. For more information on each plugin, open up their folder and read the README.md file

## Playing Shields-Up
  To play any of the plugins contained in Shields-Up, you must take them out of the `Shields-Up/` folder (it may have some variation on the name, such as `Shields.Up.V.1.1/`) and put it in the Endless Sky `plugins/` folder. (Paths are found on [this page](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingPlugins))
