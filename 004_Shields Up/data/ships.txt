	description "An ancient warship that last saw active service as a mobile fighter platform for the Imperium of Mankind's main battle fleet in the first human Hyperspace Wars. At this point in human history, shields had not yet been invented, so this battleship relied on thick ablative Nano-Mesh™ armor plating to survive.  Modern iterations of this ship include a unique on-board army of repair nano-bots that constantly maintain the vessel's armor and a few small shield generators.  One thing this ship still does exceptionally well in the modern galaxy is transport men and material, with a passenger capacity far higher than nearly any modern ship.  Designed to remain in the back lines and influence the course of a battle through fighter superiority, the Imperial Carrier sports less armor and fewer weapons than its battleship bretheren."

	description "Considered a valuable trophy of extreme cunning in some circles, the Navy views with great suspicion anyone who flies one of these. This ship has been modified with extra cargo bays, and even sacrifices precious weapon space in favor of more room to carry loot and bigger engines."
	description "	The interference plating that's been added to this ship makes it quite unlikely that illicit goods will be detected except by the most persistent inspector, while the tactical armor that's been loaded into the armory makes capturing it a difficlt proposition."
