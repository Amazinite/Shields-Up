-------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 4.0 Includes:


- An extended tutorial (requires new save, takes place after you complete starting tutorial with James)

- Servorum Dei ships!
	- Gourami: One of the biggest ships the Servorum Dei have to offer, as they don't typically focus on military might. However, it is a perfectly capable ship, able to survive against a Dominion Napoo for a large amount of time.
	- Cisco: The Cisco is the largest, multi-purpose ship the Servorum Dei have designed. It serves as a destroyer, as well as a carrier all at the same time. With it's fighters, it has the capability to provide the backbone support for a fleet.
	- Albacore: The Servorum Dei's attempts at creating an interceptor capable of defending it's land from enemy ships of similar variety.
	- Catla: The standard cargo ship for the Servorum Dei. Capable of carrying a medium load, while still being able to protect itself, the Servorum Dei use this ship in their fleets to extend their trad across the galaxy.
	- Arowana: An attempt to replicate the functionality of the Curtana to provide the Servorum Dei with a fighter capable of protecting their carriers.
	
- Militaj changes!
	- More systems
	- More of a threat to the Quarg
	- Outfits are more balanced

- First contact events for the new factions (Servorum Dei, Plenipotent Dominion, Militaj)

- Plenipotent Dominion changes!
	- Ships are more balanced
	- Events concerning them! (would require a new character for events to take place)
	
- Numerous bug fixes
	Such as:
		- Fixed event when landing on Roden
		- Fixed plasma mines not being buyable
		- Fixed numerous spelling and spacing errors in code
		- Fixed reputation problems with the new factions
		- Fixed other bugs here and there
		- Buffed alien shields (due to the human shields being buffed.)
		
- Moved the wormhole that was in Flamsteed to a more "out of the way" location
	
	
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 3.0 Includes:


- New FTek ships
	- FTek Destroyer: A refitted freighter designed to deal the damage while taking the pain, with increased turret capacity and hull strength.
	- FTek Hornet: Modeled after the Sparrow, replaces the two gun slots with a turret to provide 360 degree coverage, added together with it's enhanced shields and outfit space to make it much more effective at players looking for an early game pirate/pirate fighting life.
	- FTek Girl Scout: What happens when you bring cookies and a berserker into one ship? The FTek Girl Scout. With four gun ports and specially designed FTek Heavy Blasters, this ship brings the girl scout delivery service right to your space doorstep.
	
- Plenipotent Dominion has new ships + fleets
	- Spetum: A heavy warship thats strength rivals, if not dwarfs the Republic Cruiser's. You don't want to get put up against this beasts point-defence turrets unless you have a death-wish.
	- Napoo: The second largest Plenipotent ship, with the ability to dominate the battlefield with well sustained shields and firepower. But while Dominion ships excell in shields, they are left with a defecit of hull making them extremely vulnerable if focused on with beam weapons.
	- Kukri: The Kukri is the fast assault ship of the Dominion. It has the speed and strength to quickly jump into an unsuspecting system and wreck havoc before jumping back away as quickly as it entered.
	- Sica: The Dominion's go-to interceptor has a well balanced shield-strength combination, with the ability of holding it's own against enemies for a rather large period of time for ships of it's size.
	- Corvo: The Corvo is the Plenipotent Dominion's standard troop transport / freighter. Capable of carrying a couple squads of troops to the ground along with supplies, the Corvo is often seen in Dominion fleets.
	- Stiletto: Since the hostilities between the Plenipotent Dominion and the rest of the galaxy started, moving people around gradually became more difficult. This lead to the production of the Stiletto, which can cloak to transport high value assets or small ground parties to a target destination without fear of running into trouble.
	- Nefandous: Primarily used as a support craft for the fleet's of the Dominion, the Nefandous can hold it's own for a time until being overrun, best being used to draw the fire from the larger ships in the fleet to buy time.
	
- Added an alien race called the Militaj
	- The Militaj are helping back the Dominion up in it's war, giving it's technology and assistance to them, as well as the Servorum Dei.
	- As of now, they have a medium warship, an interceptor, a carrier/freighter mix, and a fighter. 
	- You can find them by Servorum space, accessable via jump drive.
	
- Newest version of Alphean Expansion
	
- New systems / planets have descriptions!
	- The planets in the south east added by the mod should have descriptions now!

- Added additional star systems to improve movements around the map

- Changed the colours of the new factions
	- Deep Sky = aqua/green
	- Servorum Dei = purple (possible change later, to avoid problems with mistaking them for Syndicate)
	- Plenipotent Dominio = a crimson sort of colour
	
- Fixed the Deep Sky's relations with other factions
	- Fixed annoying issues with not attacking it's enemies
	
- Fixes for Battlestar mission
	- It's actually random now! (Given in the Zorica job board occasionally)
	
- Some tweaking to ships we added in the past

Installation guide:

		Mac OS X: ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/

-	Right click plugins.zip and, using your archiver (such as winrar or 7zip on Windows) unzip the file into your endless-sky folder. (not plugins)

If you are updating the mod from a previous version, please delete the old files, then replace them with these new files.

Summary:

(For a full list of update changes for the mod, as well as a majority of the content included, please check the readme file in the z_shields-up file you will receive after downloading. You can also check a much more summarized version of the mod in the guides section of Endless-Sky, which will have a Shields Up Official Guide.)

(Please note that while we are working on a story, there is not one implemented into the mod yet)

Shields Up aims to expand upon the current vanilla game with new ships and factions, as well as a storyline. As of now, we currently have new ships ranging from early, all the way to the end game which will give players much more options with what sort of ships they will use. Along with this, we have also added a ton of new outfits, which include new weapons, new shields, and new hand to hand weapons. As for factions, the base Shields-Up mod adds three. You have the Plenipotent Dominion, the Servorum Dei, and the Militaj. Shields-Up expands on the storyline of the genetically modified humans, the Alphas, and creates two advanced factions dedicated to them. (the Plenipotent Dominion and the Servorum Dei) Meanwhile there is the advanced alien race, the Militaj, locked in a conflict with the Quarg that has lasted for entire centuries.

We have added an extended tutorial (after completing the vanilla tutorial, press "spaceport" at the planet you leave James on, our extended tutorial will vary depending on what starter ship you chose)

A massive new section of the galaxy to explore (Found in the South-East section of the vanilla game)

A brand new corrupt and shady business, FTek™

There are now speeded courier missions, in which a passenger or passengers need to get somewhere by a deadline.

Northern escorts may now be something other than a freighter sometimes.

We have made The Deep it's seperate faction (due to certain events that will take place in our story)

Note that this plugin locks the Bactrian until you've earned the trust of the Deep Sky faction. This is accomplished through the main storyline.

Everything listed above is merely the two base Shields-Up mods, and does not include details of any of the other 3 mods included, which are:

Shields-Up
Friendly-Technology (FTek™)
Alphean Expansion
That_Someone
Tufton

Thank you.
