	description "The 400mm Railgun is a modern marvel. Using advanced Neodynium-alloy electromagnets, the Railgun hurls an M50-400 depleted Uranium slug at near relativistic speeds almost 4000 kilometers towards the intended target using quantum computer-enhanced targeting algorithms. The size of these guns necessitates a long reload time, while the electromagnets consume a significant amount of a ship's energy with every shot fired."
