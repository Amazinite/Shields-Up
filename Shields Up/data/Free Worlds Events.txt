			`The fleet in orbit around Wayfarer is pitifully small, surely not enough to take on more than a couple of Navy capital ships. JJ orders one of their communication officers to try to establish a secure link to Bourne or to any Free Worlds post on the other side of the Navy blockade. After about ten minutes, the officer returns and says, "Sir, we're receiving communications from New Tibet. You need to talk to them."`
			`	"Our fleet is there?" asks JJ.`
			`	"No sir, the Syndicate. They're under attack by the Syndicate."`
			`	"What?" says JJ. He rushes into the communication room, and you and Freya follow. On the video screen is a Buddhist monk in a maroon robe; behind him, you see other monks rushing about with none of the serenity you would usually expect of them. "What's going on there?" asks JJ.`
			`	The monk explains, "Yesterday a Syndicate ship landed near our monastery, and the pilot sought refuge with us. He brings evidence that the Syndicate, or some faction within the Syndicate, was behind the attacks on Geminus and Martini."`
			choice
				`	"Why would the Syndicate do that?"`
				`	"What sort of evidence?"`
					goto evidence
			`	"He claims that a certain faction within the Syndicate values economic growth above all else," says the monk, "and incited this war for that reason."`
			`	"That's insane," says Freya.`
			`	"But not completely implausible," says JJ.`
			label evidence
			`	The monk says, "He brought a great deal of evidence. Plans for a nuclear device. Data from underground testing. A manufactured bomb casing. Samples of fissile material. And he named the planet where the development was done: Mutiny, in the Gienah system. We hid his ship in a cave. A day later, a Syndicate fleet appeared in orbit. They do not know where the defector landed, but they say they will destroy whatever settlement is harboring him unless he is returned to them immediately."`
			`	After a moment, JJ says, "If these allegations are true, if we can prove that the Free Worlds was innocent of any involvement in those attacks, the Republic might make peace with us, or at least agree to a ceasefire. I vote that we try to shelter this defector and hear his story."`
			`	"And if it's a lie," says Freya, "and we refuse the Syndicate's demands, we lose our only ally. And many civilians will be killed, as well. I care about justice, but trading a definite ally for a slim possibility of peace: that is an unwise investment. I vote that we hand this man over to the Syndicate."`
			`	The monk says, "We want to see justice done, and peace prevail. If you ask us to, we will flee to the mountains and take refuge until help arrives."`
			`	As the third Council member present, you have the deciding vote, and the entire course of this war may rest on your decision.`

				`	"Well, she's not here, and I say we can't afford to lose the Syndicate as an ally."`

			`	JJ seems very relieved at your choice. "I think that's the right choice, Captain," he says. "We can take the fleet we have here, sweep up north to avoid the thickest part of the Navy's occupying fleet, and cut over to New Tibet to drive the Syndicate ships away. Let's just hope these monks can stay hidden until then."`

			`It doesn't take long to find the monastery that contacted you earlier, but nothing is left of it but burnt-out shells of buildings. You land and look around for survivors. You find several corpses dressed in maroon robes, some of them badly burnt, but no sign of the defector or the monk you spoke with earlier.`

				`	(Give up and contact the rest of the Free Worlds fleet to figure out what to do next.)`
					goto leave
			`	You wait around for a while, but this mountain valley seems to be entirely desolate. Then finally, when you are about to give up hope, Freya spots the distant figures of a few dozen people coming down the side of one of the mountains.`
				goto gunboat
			label leave
			`	You are just about to leave when Freya spots something and points. "Look," she says, "someone is coming down the mountain slope toward us." Sure enough, it's a group of several dozen people wearing the distinctive robes of the monks.`
			label gunboat
			`	As you wait for them to approach, JJ receives a message from one of the militia crews. "Sir, you have incoming! A scout ship, with Republic markings. Apparently unarmed. Shall we intercept them?"`
			`	"Oathkeepers?" asks JJ. "Or ordinary Navy? Who are they?"`
			`	The voice on the other end pauses. "Neither. Navy Intelligence."`
			`	JJ thinks about that for a second, then says, "Let them land. But follow them down, and if you see so much as a hint of them powering up weapons, blow them out of the sky. Understand?" The officer acknowledges his order and signs off.`
			`	As the group of monks approaches from the mountainside, the scout ship comes in for a landing and skids to a halt in the dirt a few dozen meters away. A woman steps off it. She has dark skin, and is dressed entirely in black. Even the whites of her eyes are black: when she gets closer, you can see that it is actually a scleric tattoo, an intricate Celtic knotwork pattern inked into the whites of her eyes. She sees you staring at her, and winks at you with a friendly grin.`
			choice
				`	"I'm Captain <last> of the Free Worlds. What is your business here?"`
				`	"Who are you, and what gives you the right to land on our planet?"`
					goto hostile
			`	"My name is Raven," she says. "I'm here to question this defector. If he is telling the truth, our war with you will end today." She pauses, then adds, grimly, "And, another war will begin."`
				goto questioning
			label hostile
			`	She frowns. "My name is Raven," she says. "I am here to question this defector. If you are interested in knowing the truth, you will allow me to do so."`
			label questioning
			`	The monks approach, and you see that among them is a man in more ordinary attire, who must be the defector. "Now," says Raven, "I will question him alone, on my ship."`
			choice
				`	"No, we insist on being present for your interrogation."`
					goto present
				`	"Very well, we'll wait outside."`
			`	"No!" says JJ. "We're staying here."`
			label present
			`	She hesitates for a long moment. This is probably going against whatever orders she is following. But finally she says, "Very well." The monks step aside. She approaches the defector, and reaches out her hands to him. Hesitantly, he takes her hands. It's an oddly intimate scene, the two of them quietly holding hands and locking eyes - not like any interrogation you have seen before. "Now," she says, "tell me your story."`
			`	"My name is Sawyer," says the man. "I'm a physicist, a Syndicate employee. We had a secret project on Mutiny, a planet in a pirate system. We were developing nuclear weapons." He hesitates, and looks away for a second, then says, "They told me it was for fighting the pirates. I didn't realize otherwise until--"`
			`	"That is a lie," says Raven, calmly.`
			`	He seems flustered. "Okay, they didn't tell me what the weapons were for, and I didn't ask."`
			choice
				`	"Why would the Syndicate attack the Republic?"`
				`	"Why did you wait so long to report this?"`
					goto wait
			`	They both seem surprised at you asking a question. "I'm not sure," says Sawyer, "but the Syndicate's profits have more than doubled since this war began. Maybe they knew they would benefit from it more than anyone."`
			`	"What led you to report this?" asks Raven.`
			label wait
			`	He says, "It was when I heard that there had been another major battle. Up until then I had been telling myself that the worst of the damage was done. But after that battle, I knew that millions more could die because of our crime, and that I had the power to stop it."`
			`	Raven continues to ask questions: who was involved, how the facility was hidden, where the raw materials come from. At one point, JJ pulls you aside and says, "She must be a Questioner. How they operate is a tightly kept secret. I'd always assumed their methods were... a bit more medieval."`
			`	Finally, Raven is satisfied, and radios her ship. "He's telling the truth," she tells them. "Send word to the generals at once. And, release the captive."`
			`	The door of her ship slides open, and another woman steps out - shakily, hesitantly, shielding her eyes against the sunlight. It takes you a few seconds to realize that it's Katya.`
			`	As you all rush over to greet Katya, Raven taps your shoulder and says quietly, "Meet me in the main spaceport in a few hours and we'll figure out what's going to happen next." She returns to her ship.`
