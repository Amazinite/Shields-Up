	description "Designed to allow more payload space on fighters and drones, these experimental engines combine both thrust and steering functionality, resulting in some tonnage savings but at increased cost and decreased efficiency compared to conventional ion engines."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."
