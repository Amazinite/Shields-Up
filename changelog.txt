		* (Shields Up) Removed the last of the SU systems that were connected to vanilla space.
		* (Shields Up) Darkened the Sentar galaxy image so that the systems are easier to see.
		* (Shields Up) Removed a bunch of Mil'taj and Plenipotent Dominion systems as to take up less space on the map.
		* (Phil's Flavours) Shortened a lot of the names of ships so they don't run off certain panels in game.

Shields Up Reborn v1.1
	New Content
		* (Shields Up and That Someone) Created first contact missions for the warring Pug, Hai (Absconded), Mil'taj (talk to some nearby Quarg), and Servorum
		* (Shields Up) You can now buy Servorum ships and outfits... or at least most of them... and only after you talk to them for the first time
		* (Shields Up) Made the nebula a lot more cooler by turning them from "planets" into system haze. See the release image for what I mean: https://github.com/Amazinite/Shields-Up/releases/tag/V1.1
	Content Changes
		* (Alphean's) Due to Takarada not wanting to continue working on them and me not liking the idea Alr space has been removed
		* (Pompano's) Moved the Tuk'ux systems from the east to the far west (the wormhole system is in the same place, though)
		* (Shields Up) Changed Paul's mission chain to now offer no matter what class of ship you have (previously only offered if you had an interceptor, freighter, or transport)
		* (Shields Up) Removed the jobs from Deep Sky space (some of them were old, and the implementation of jobs in Deep Sky space wasn't the most eligant)

		* (Shields Up) Standardized "Mil'taj" to the correct spelling of the race
		* (Shields Up) You can no longer gain reputation with the Mil'taj or hail their ships/planets
		* (Shields Up and Alphean's) Removed a bunch of old missions
		* (Shields Up and That Someone) MASSIVELY changed the layout of the map; the Mil'taj are now more to the south, the Dominion are now east of the Mil'taj, the Servorum are now north of the Deep, and a lot of uninhabited systems that were connected to vanilla space were removed (and as such, changed a lot of fleet spawns and planet attributes)
		* (That Someone) Renamed the researcher and attacker Pug to the blue and red Pug
		* (Shields Up) Changed the Mil'taj to have a mint green color on the government map
		* (Shields Up) Changed a bunch of government attitudes; the Republic and Deep Sky now have a 1:1 relationship (killing one hurts your reputation with them as much as it does the other government), the Dominion will never like you, and the Servorum hate the Dominion and Mil'taj 
		* (Shields Up and Alphean's) Removed the ships from the two mentioned plugins from appearing in NPC fleets; next update will see a big fleet overhaul that makes sure that fleets include ships and outfits from the entire pack
	Balance Changes
		* (Shields Up) Buffed the total HP of the Servorum ships and nerfed their generators
		* (Phil's) Buffed the Alliance Battleship engine space by one point
		* (Shields Up) Dominion ships now have built-in armories and use androids to defend themselves in combat

		* All plugins now have icons and about files to be viewed in the plugins tab of the preferences
