	description "Tactical armor is extremely useful in the close-quarters confusion that is typical of boarding actions, as the small arms carried by most crews simply bounce off." 
	description "The purchase price of tactical armor generally includes specialized training in its use for the crew member assigned to it. It requires a small amount of additional outfit space for maintenance."

	description "Breacher cannons are the most dangerous man-portable weapon that money can buy, although that's not the same thing as being the most dangerous weapon out there. Of course, for the cost of equipping an entire crew with them, it is cheaper to simply buy another ship."
	description "The purchase price of a breacher cannon generally includes specialized training in its use, and it requires a moderate amount of outfit space for maintenance and training areas."
