			`The growing threat of the Plenipotent Dominion in the south-east is worry-some, to say the least. They are comprised of Alphas, a genetic experiment by humanity to create a perfect human gone wrong. It was hundreds of years ago when the first revolt of the Alphas occurred; a band of them took control of multiple systems until finally being thwarted with the help of the Deep and their advanced technology. They had dissappeared for a long time until recently when hyperspace lanes appeared and connected their territory to the southern end of human space. These Alphas are dangerous, and everyone knows of their weapons of mass destruction that have been developed. It's only a matter of time before these unfriendly conditions spark a dangerous series of events...`

			`	Immediately after landing, you are greeted by a man wearing a suit and tie with neatly combed hair. He seems like a friendly individual, and quickly introduces himself; "Hello there! My name is Dank, Dank Forrest." He extends his hand and you shake it. He then continues his introduction. "You seem like the kind of pilot with experience, which is why I'm entrusting you with something very important."`

			`	He ignores your ridiculously ignorant statement and continues talking anyways. "Basically, my client has located a massive stache of Federation technology. That means that if we can get there before any of our competitors, we get access to some of the best equipment in the entire galaxy. What do you say? Will you take me to the Menkar system? I need to get to the planet Icefall as fast as possible, you can take whatever tech you want once we're there as well."`

			`	The man is slightly taken aback by your reply, and an evil grin creeps up on his face. "Are you telling me that you are passing up the opportunity to get your hands on Federation technology? You know, the most advanced inhabitants of this galaxy? Because my client has found a stache of their rare weapons on the planet Icefall in the Menkar system, and any pilot willing to take me there is sure to get a large share of the contents of the stache."`

			`	You land in the main spaceport of the planet Icefall. The man steps towards the exit hatch of your ship that you had just opened. He takes a look back at you. "Alright captain, thank you for the ride!" He leaves your ship and disappears into a large crowd of crew walking along a strip of road.`
			`It isn't until you've been staring outside your ship which is decreasing in temperature to match the freezing temperature of the planet that you think: Did he ever tell you where that stache was?`
			``
			`	Back in your captain's chair you debate whether or not you should even give the deception even more thought when a blue light started flashing on your command console. You push the 'allow transmittion' button located next to the light and a cold female voice starts playing through the speakers located on either end of your console.`
			`	"Attention all pilots flying in Syndicate space, at this moment Syndicate forces are engaged in combat with a large fleet of advanced ships sporting the colours of the Plenipotent Dominion. It is requested that all civilians stay far away from Southern Syndicate space." Like that, the message clicks off as easily as it had clicked on.`

Killing that guy could only help the pirates and the Alphas, and I doubt the pirates even have the mental capacity to think to poison someone, they're just a weak lot of idiots if you ask me."`
