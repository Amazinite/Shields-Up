Tens of thousands of ships are busily flying around, objects appear and disappear around the station. Unfortunately, the only people who work here are Quarg, and outsiders are not permitted to view their outfits. They do however, have a refueling station. `
	spaceport `The same strange organic looking tentacles attach to your ship again, though you feel more relaxed walking down the tube this time. The spaceport is completely sealed off from the rest of the station. This station is completely clean like the last one, you see that any speck of dust or dirt that comes off of your body disapears in an instant.`

planet Clark

	landscape land/valley3
	description `Clark is a recently settled world, and most of its surface remains covered in dense forests and uninhabited mountains. Because clearing new land is so difficult, agriculture here has not grown far beyond the level of subsistence farming. But the temperate climate has drawn several million settlers, most of whom work in factories that have been planted here by off-world corporations to take advantage of the cheap labor.`
	description `	The low cost of living and virtually zero unemployment rate make poverty and crime relatively rare occurrences. Instead there is a pioneering spirit, a startup-world attitude that anything is attainable with a bit of hard work and frugality.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is at the heart of one of Clark's largest cities, surrounded by smokestacks and factories. There are a few hangars owned by different corporations where their cargo ships can load and unload, but you are relegated to a set of concrete landing pads farther from the main buildings. Large trucks rumble by carrying carts loaded down with cargo crates.`

	description `This moon was destroyed by the Korath. Ten thousand years ago, the Korath and Quarg were on equal footing. The planet was a far outpost for the Quarg, used to monitor the Korath. The Korath employed a Sun'ik attack on the outpost, ripping the crust of the entire moon in two, and breaking galactic law. The Drak, in response to the attack, destroyed every star system and planet Korath-owned near Quarg space. They also laid waste to their homeworld, and banished them to the core. They now reside on one virtually unchanged world. `

planet Dupelepe
	attributes quargworld
	landscape land/sky7
	description `The planet is a small moon, orbiting a gas planet with small amounts of water vapor and methane in its atmosphere giving it the blue-green color. The moon itself is typical of the Quarg, small with a thin atmosphere, however it is heavily populated with sprawling cities covering the surface. Each of the cities are a different color and texture. There are ships of various colors and designs flying around the planet, some are tens of kilometers long. `
	spaceport `The spaceport is a lofty structure, both towering into the sky and plunging several miles beneath the surface. There are sections of landing pads for various species' ship hulls, there is even a section for humans, though it is unfinished. You dock your ship in one of the hangars designed for a ship twice the size of yours, because the proportions are so odd you face banging an antenae off versus inconveniencing an alien freighter. `

Although the planet is mostly filled with factories and military bases, there are quite a few large cities, putting the total population of the planet around two billion, although people often get sick due to the pollution from the many factories. The factories generate a purple smoke that is very visible at certain times of day. It's rather beautiful until you remind yourself how many toxic fumes you're inhailing.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is rather run down, it is poorly managed, which is rather evident when exiting your ship, you can see that the landing pad is not well supported. It's hard to believe that this is the capital of a race hoping to wipe out most of humanity.`

	landscape land/mountain9
	description `A Quarg planet far from their homelands, settled purely for the purpose of providing the Quarg the planet on the frontlines of their war with the Militaj. Due to Quarg not being able to breath the air here, the only development on the planet are defences for holding off the Militaj. The structures have isolated breathing conditions that result in them being off limits to Humans. The same goes for the Militaj, who require similar atmospheric conditions as Humans do.`
	spaceport `The Quarg you are used to would typically welcome a human on their planets, however due to the location of this planet, and the fact that the Militaj are allied with the Plenipotent Dominion makes the Quarg here very apprehensive of your being here. There is only one structure on the planet that Humans are allowed in, as it was designed to be breathable for Humans.`

planet Genchok
	attributes quargworld
	landscape land/desert4
	description `A slightly montainous moon, the Quarg use this moon for power generation, using the planet's violent volcanic and tectonic activity as a power source. Energy is harvested through submantle turbines, made of tungsten. Operations here have been going on for longer than humans have existed, the automated machines that work here have only been replaced twice in the moon's service. Though outdated by Quarg standards, it still sends power to planets with low energy consumption.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is tiny, allowing only a maximum of five ships at a time. Not that it needs more, because you are the only one on the planet. The landing pad deploys an energy dome around you and your ship, and fills with enough air to allow you to breathe. Your ship is refueled by pilotless drones while you look at the barren landscape before you. `

	spaceport `The only structure on the surface of the planet is a heavily guarded military base. The only section of the base opened to the public is watched closely, and sells a rather limited supply of weapons.`

	description `The moon is a small farming world, crops are grown and harvested several times a day. There are large dome structures around the moon, which occasionally spray bacteria into the atmosphere that are genetically modified to duplicate into whatever plant they come in contact with. There is one city on the planet, it sits on an island far away enough from the main continent that the bacteria can't get to the inhabitants. `
	spaceport `The spaceport is a large closed dome, hovering a few thousand meters above the city. All visitors are required to wear a spandex-like suit that will prevent you from stealing any bacteria, and also keeps track of what bacteria are on you at all times.  The spaceport itself is filled with luscious blue foliage, perhaps to showoff the crops on the main continent. The Hai frequent this moon alot, as it is the first gas station on the way to Novae. `

planet Kor'ein

	landscape land/sky8
	description `The planet seems to be completely destroyed, though many buildings still stick out through the massive lava flows. The planet was demolished by the Korath through a Sur'nik war amongst the inhabitants some fifty thousand years ago. The planet's twenty billion inhabitants perished in the event.  Unlike Hope, no effective means of evacuation could be achieved due to the Korath's lack of an organized navy or government. `

planet Kullat
	attributes Servorum
	landscape land/Fimage13
	description `Perhaps the most misleading of the Servorum Dei's planets; Kullat looks like a beautiful, undeveloped planet from the surface. It makes it hard to believe that this is their capital, however there are a few towns scattered around, each with a huge circular hole in the middle large enough for something even of a Bactrian's size to fit in. Deep inside those holes are large spherical openings for ships to land, with tunnels connecting all the towns on the surface together, and all the tunnels eventually converging at the Servorum Dei's capital city built deep under one of the many tall mountains.`
	spaceport `The air is thick with a smoke eminating from the underground factories around the landing pads, with Alphas and Humans alike walking here and there to the different merchants and structures.`

	spaceport `The 'outpost' turned out to be more like a massive room with large collums supporting the roof, which was metal that held up the surface of the planet directly above it. It wouldn't be surprising if the room went on for many kilometers, and the distance from the floor to the ceiling was near impossible to measure, however even the largest of the Militaj ships had room to take off and fly around with room to spare, although you find it hard to land due to the room's floor being filled to the max with Militaj ships and weapons, and there are some for sale, even to you.`

The cities float on graviton emitters located on the underside of the building. Due to the massive impact this technology has on the planet, a separate graviton emitter orbits on pricisely the opposite end of the planet, cancelling out the gravitational waves. This also means that cities cover one side the planet, while the other side is only inhabited by large floating needles. `
	spaceport `The spaceport cosists of tiny disks that float around like the cities. Your ship's landing gear is deployed against your will, and your ship lands on just five disks, some fifty meters away from the edge of the city.
