Thanks to all those who have made this plugin possible and provided content for it.
Big thanks to Tufton, That Someone, Takarada, Friendly Neighbor, and Direstorm for all working on Shields Up before me (Derpy Horse)
Thanks to PompanoZombie and Phil for providing their plugins to the Shields Up pack.

Credit to MillionthVector for the Servorum and Dominion ship sprites, but hopefully we'll be using different sprites later. :)
