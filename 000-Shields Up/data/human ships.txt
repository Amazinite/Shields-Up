	description "The cheapest transport ship to boast a turret, the Skybus is a fan favorite among the less wealthy of the galaxy. Some see it as an alternative to the Scout, as both have a similar capacity to hold passengers and have the same amount of weapons, but others chastise the Skybus for being too slow and unreliable when defending against pirates."
	description "	Although well-armed for its size and purpose, the Skybus is still advised not to wade into heavy combat, and instead to escape dangerous situations."

	description "Sky Dinghies cannot fit hyperdrives or travel without the aid of a tending vessel. In ancient times when escaping a planet's grasp was difficult and expensive, larger ships would never land, instead relying on these craft to shuttle men and materials into the sky."

	description "An ancient warship that last saw active service as a mobile fighter platform for the Imperium of Mankind's main battle fleet in the first human Hyperspace Wars. At this point in human history, shields had not yet been invented, so this battleship relied on thick ablative Nano-Meshâ„¢ armor plating to survive.  Modern iterations of this ship include a small shield generator.  Designed to remain in the back lines and influence the course of a battle through fighter superiority, the Imperial Carrier sports less armor and fewer weapons than its battleship bretheren."
